## Projects
### Project Name: School Management System , Link: [https://github.com/SHOJIB-80/School-Management-System-]
The School Management System is a simple Java-based application designed to efficiently manage the core operations of a school. It allows administrators to handle student, teacher, and course data while ensuring secure access through user authentication.

- Technologies: Java
Key Features:

Student Management:
Add, view, and manage student details like name and age.

Teacher Management:
Add, view, and manage teacher details like name and subject expertise.

Course Management:
Create courses and assign students and teachers to them.

User Authentication:
Validate user credentials for secure access to the system.

Centralized Control:
The Main.java file acts as the hub, integrating all modules and providing an interactive menu for easy navigation.
This system is an efficient tool for organizing school operations and serves as a foundational project for understanding Java concepts like object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular design.

### Project Name: The Hangman Game ,  Link: (https://github.com/SHOJIB-80/The-Hangman)
Introduction:
"The Hangman Game" is a simple and engaging word-guessing game where players attempt to uncover a hidden word one letter at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure is drawn, adding suspense and challenge to the gameplay.

Used Language: C
Key Features:
Random Word Selection: The game randomly chooses a word for unpredictable and varied challenges.
Limited Guesses: Players have a set number of chances to guess the correct word.
Dynamic Feedback: Displays the partially guessed word and visually tracks progress with the hangman figure.
Input Validation: Ensures inputs are valid and prevents duplicate guesses.
Replay Option: Allows players to restart and enjoy multiple rounds of the game.
This project is a great way to learn C programming basics while building a fun and interactive game.
